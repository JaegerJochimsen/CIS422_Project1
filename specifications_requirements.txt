    Purpose of Meeting: read and discuss project handout, make note of specifications

Key: 
    (#) bullet number for case
    -> Option/possible add-on or interpretation or implementation options
    * Mandatory Subconditions

| Use Case-based Reqs:| (See Use Cases, pg. 3-4 of Handout)
+++++++++++++++++++++++

    Use Case A:
    (4) On-deck display should be at the forefront, never hidden by other focused windows (think Zoom-style bar)
            -> On-deck may be hidden from screensharing or presentations but remain visible on host system
            -> Flagging of students may be hidden from class for discrete marking
    (5) System "re-jumbles" names between runs (maintains randomness)
            -> On-deck students from previous run may continue as On-deck for current run until removed?
    (7) Arrow Key Input or Numeric Key Input for interaction
    (8) Visual representation of On-deck is a queue-like gui; removed students cause "shift-down" of remaining On-deck students and new student is
        added to the end
    (9) Highlight students that are flagged and provide contact info adjacent to name

    Use Case B:
    (1-3) Generate log files containing student info for flagged and cold-called students
    
    Use Case C:
    (1) Tab-delimited input for roster
    (3) List changes to roster after reading new input
        *If changes are accepted then overwrite old roster to include changes
        *Maintain data for unmodified student entries

    Use Case D:
    (1) Long-term/multi-run performance/review file (different from log files)
        -> Updated at the end of each run prior to shutdown
