Data structs to hold students: 
    *Dictionary with nodes
        -> node contains: name, time since selection, flagged status, message

Saving protocol (for existing data structure ordering)
    -> save as local program file and then read in to data struct on boot-up

GUI 
    -> library
    -> configuration for library
    -> design 
    -> clicks, buttons for interaction

Button config scripts

Install scripts for additional packages (check for updates, install necessary packages)
    -> maybe allow to sense system architecture

Randomization algorithm
    -> maybe based on # questions answered
Flagging algorithm
Notes for students
Cloud/online backup? EXTRA
